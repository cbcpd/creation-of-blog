# creation-of-blog
I build a Blog application with Django that allows users to create, edit, and delete posts. The homepage will list all blog posts, and there will be a dedicated detail page for each individual post. Django is capable of making more advanced stuff that's the reason I use Django.It is completely designed by creative and innovative stuffs.
